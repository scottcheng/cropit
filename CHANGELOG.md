### Migration guide

Markup in v0.4:

```html
<div class="image-editor">
  <!-- .cropit-image-preview-container is needed for background image to work -->
  <div class="cropit-image-preview-container">
    <div class="cropit-image-preview"></div>
  </div>
  <!-- Other stuff -->
</div>
```

New markup in v0.5:

```html
<div class="image-editor">
  <div class="cropit-preview"></div>
  <!-- Other stuff -->
</div>
```

Note that `.cropit-image-preview-container` element is no longer needed, and all you need is a `.cropit-preview` (previously `.cropit-image-preview`) whether or not you want image background that goes beyond the preview area. New markup structure (after cropit is initialized) is as follows:

```jade
.cropit-preview
  .cropit-preview-background-container
    img.cropit-preview-background
  .cropit-preview-image-container
    img.cropit-preview-image
```

Note the class name changes:

```
.cropit-image-preview              => .cropit-preview
.cropit-image-background-container => .cropit-preview-background-container
.cropit-image-background           => .cropit-preview-background
```

Make sure to update class names in your selectors.

### Breaking changes

* Markup structure and class name changes. See migration guide above for details.

### New features

* Added rotation APIs `rotateCW` and `rotateCCW`, which rotates the image by 90 degrees clockwise/counterclockwise. If, after rotated by 90 degrees, the dimension of the image no longer meets the requirements, it would be rotated by 180 degrees.
* Render image using CSS transformation, which drastically improved performance.

### Bug fixes

* Now remote images are loaded through AJAX and rendered as data URI strings, which addresses CORS issues. `allowCrossOrigin` option is no longer necessary and therefore removed.

## 0.4.5 (September 27, 2015)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed an issue where cropit exports blank images on Safari. Removed progressive resizing, which may degrade cropped image quality. For high quality resizing, using a server-side tool is recommended.

## 0.4.4 (September 12, 2015)

### New features

* Added getters and setters for `initialZoom`, `exportZoom`, `minZoom` and `maxZoom`
* Added `onOffsetChange` and `onZoomChange` callback
* onFileChange now passes back the event object

### Bug fixes

* Fixed bug where `image-loaded` class is removed if a small image is loaded and rejected

## 0.4.1 (August 2, 2015)

### Bug fixes

* Fixed crossOrigin preventing image from loading in Safari and Firefox.

## 0.4.0 (July 7, 2015)

### New features

* Added option to allow small image to be either zoomed down its original size or stretch to fill/fit container

### Breaking changes

* Replaced `rejectSmallImage` option with `smallImage`. `rejectSmallImage: true` is now `smallImage: 'reject'`, and `rejectSmallImage: false` is now `smallImage: 'allow'`.

## 0.3.2 (July 3, 2015)

### New features

* Added back `allowCrossOrigin` option

## 0.3.1 (June 30, 2015)
